## Project Overview
Breast cancer is a significant health issue, and early detection can lead to improved survival rates. This project uses machine learning algorithms for classifying breast cancer based on relevant features, providing a reliable diagnostic tool.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes key features that correlate with breast cancer, such as cell nuclei characteristics. Please provide a link to the dataset if it's publicly available or specify its source and licensing.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Breast_Cancer_Prediction.git
   cd Breast_Cancer_Prediction
   ```

2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Breast_Cancer.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Model
This project uses a non-deep learning machine learning model, possibly a classifier such as Logistic Regression,  or Random Forest, to analyze the data and classify the instances of breast cancer. Further model details are available in the notebook.

## Results
The model achieves the following performance metrics:

- **Accuracy:** 0.96
- **Precision:** 0.96
- **Recall:**   0.99
